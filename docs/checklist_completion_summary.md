## Key Features

### 1. **TDD Methodology Integration**

**18 Feature Tickets** follow full TDD cycle:
- Phase 1: Write Tests (Red) - Create test files, write failing tests
- Phase 2: Implement (Green) - Write code to pass tests
- Phase 3: Verify (Green) - Run tests, check coverage
- Phase 4: Manual Test - Test with curl/commands
- Phase 5: Git Operations - Add, commit, push

**Examples**:
- BP-008: Implement SQLAlchemy Models (60 tasks)
- BP-011: Implement Bonus API Endpoints (50 tasks)
- BP-016: Implement Data Extraction Pipeline (44 tasks)
- BP-022: Implement LLM Client (32 tasks)
- BP-033: Implement Security Features (61 tasks)

### 2. **Unique Task IDs**

Every task has a unique identifier:
- Format: `BP-XXX-YY` (e.g., BP-008-14)
- Enables precise tracking and reference
- Total: 1,200+ unique task IDs

### 3. **Atomic Task Granularity**

Each task is:
- ✅ **2-5 minutes** to complete
- ✅ **Specific**: Exact file paths and commands
- ✅ **Verifiable**: Expected outputs documented
- ✅ **Sequential**: Logical ordering within tickets

### 4. **Complete Verification**

Every implementation includes:
- Unit test execution commands
- Integration test commands
- Manual testing with curl
- Database verification queries
- Coverage checking commands
- Expected outputs documented

### 5. **Git Discipline**

Every ticket ends with:
- `git add` specific files
- `git commit -m "[BP-XXX] Description"`
- `git push origin master`
